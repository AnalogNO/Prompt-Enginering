# Prompt-Enginering

This is my personal knowledge base on Prompt Engineering. This repository is a collection of insights, methods, examples, and best practices related to the art of crafting prompts for models like ChatGPT.

I've found it hard to find good, centralized information on prompt engineering, so I'm making one for myself to reference. In creating this resource, I've utilized models like ChatGPT and tools like Claude to help me synthesize and organize the information.
